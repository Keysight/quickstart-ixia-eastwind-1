EastWind and CloudLens on AWS
Eastwind Cloud Network Sensors, powered by Ixia CloudLens, provides complete visibility across your Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) networks and leverages the cloud provider to scale up or down as needed.  With this solution, security teams benefit from Eastwind Breach Analytics and the breadth of Ixia CloudLens visibility to better understand and address your expanding attack surface.
Benefits include:
* Intelligence: A concise picture of what is happening across all your cloud infrastructure providers is a must to all organizations.  With support from AWS, your teams work in lock-step to securely deploy line-of-business applications across a wide range of public and private infrastructure.
* Insight: Understanding and integrating the activity inside and out of the traditional corporate network allows teams to evaluate which threats and threat actors are active and posing risk.
* Integrated Response and Incident Data: Giving incident responders the integrated data they need to more effectively identify and remediate threats and breaches is critical to business success.
