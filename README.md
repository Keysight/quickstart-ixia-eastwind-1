# Ixia CloudLens with Eastwind on AWS Cloud

This Quick Start sets up a CloudLens platform, using Eastwind Cloud Network Sensors to provide customers visibility across their AWS infrastructre.

Eastwind Cloud Network Sensors, powered by Ixia CloudLens, provides complete visibility across your Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) networks and leverages the cloud provider to scale up or down as needed.  With this solution, security teams benefit from Eastwind Breach Analytics and the breadth of Ixia CloudLens visibility to better understand and address your expanding attack surface.  

Benefits include:  
•	**Intelligence:** A concise picture of what is happening across your network, both on-premises or in the cloud is a must to all organizations.  
•	**Insight:** Understanding and integrating the activity inside and out of the traditional corporate network allows teams to evaluate which threats and threat actors are active and posing risk.  
•	**Integrated Response and Incident Data:** Giving incident responders the integrated data they need to more effectively identify and remediate threats and breaches is critical to business success.
