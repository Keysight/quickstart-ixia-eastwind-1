## Security with CloudLens and Eastwind on AWS

This Quick Start sets up a CloudLens platform and uses Eastwind Cloud Network Sensors to give users visibility into their AWS infrastructure.

CloudLens is a data visibility platform that provides data access and capture, data grooming, and data delivery to security and monitoring tools. Eastwind Cloud Network Sensors are powered by CloudLens to provide intelligence and insight to help you identify and respond to threats in the cloud. This Quick Start deploys the Eastwind CloudVu sensor.  

The Quick Start offers two deployment options:

- Deploying CloudLens and Eastwind into a new virtual private cloud (VPC) on AWS
- Deploying CloudLens and Eastwind into an existing VPC on AWS

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
